This repo consists code from [Hyperskill project.][1] It was very 
helpful for me to dive fast into kotlin.

Several words about project:
It's a simple search engine based on hash table: program
parses an incoming file and splits it into tokens. Then 
it stores each token with list of numbers of lines where 
this token located in the file.
